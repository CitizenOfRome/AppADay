Engage - An Active User Counter: Feb 5th 2012
-----------------------
Engage gives you the number of users currently on a web-page. The web-page only needs to include a tiny JavaScript file and Engage takes care of the rest.
Engage runs on a Web2Py backend, so everything in this directoy must be placed in the 'applications/init' folder of your web2py installation, which you can download from http://www.web2py.com/ .
To use Engage with your website, include "http://Your_Web2py_Server/init/static/js/engage.js" in the HEAD section of your page and an element having "engage_counter" as its id, like "<span id="engage_counter"></span>", where the count will be displayed.
