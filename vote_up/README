Vote-Up: Feb 13th 2012
-----------------------
Vote-up is a Stack-Exchange-like rating system that is still in its infancy.
It runs on a Web2Py back-end, so everything in this directoy must be placed in the 'applications/vote_up' folder of your web2py installation, which you can download from http://www.web2py.com/ .
